<main> <section id="welcome"> <h1>Welcome</h1> <p> Our mission as a school is to create a learning environment that <b>encourages student growth</b>, both in academics, and as individuals. Our school pioneers <b>new teaching strategies</b> to help students <b>learn their best.</b> We encourage students to learn at their own pace, and provide a framework to help students build interest in learning. </p> </section> <section id="curriculum"> <h1>Curriculum</h1> <p> Our school utilizes a <b>project-based</b> teaching strategy to better prepare students for the real world. Instead of daily assignments, students are tasked with working on <b>overarching projects</b> that <b>encompass multiple subject areas.</b> This strategy allows us to teach both core subject areas and other important skills such as <b>collaboration and critical thinking</b> simultaneously, while keeping students <b>interested in learning.</b> </p> <p> While at Autumn Hills Academy, students are encouraged to learn about subjects such as <b>music and the arts.</b> Alongside our collection of courses on topics from the <b>humanities</b> to <b>applied science and technology</b>, students are also offered <b>1-to-1 tutoring</b> and <b>assistance on personal projects.</b> </p> </section> <section id="grading"> <h1>Grading</h1> <p> Research has shown that our traditional methods of grading do not accurately represent a student's understanding of content. At Autumn Hills Academy, we utilize a system that grades students on their understanding of concepts, not assignments. Each individual project-based assignment is broken up into multiple different concepts. Students then, if the student is not happy with their grade, they have the opportunity to return to these concept areas to prove their understanding at any point in the school year. </p> </section> <section id="campus"> <h1>Our Campus</h1> <p> <i> <b>Note:</b> Construction of new campus to be finished by beginning of the next school year. Images are examples of architectural styles featured in new buildings. </i> </p> <p> Nothing quite represents Autumn Hills Academy's drive for innovation than our campus. Designed from the ground up to be both as energy-efficient as humanly possible, and a perfect learning environment, our 25 acre complex, located in the wilderness of King County, Washington, has it all. </p> <div class="image"> <img src="/patrick-schneider-Przxls7qiEA-unsplash.b2b4787c.jpg" alt=""> <p><i>Large double-glazed windows allow massive amounts of natural light and heat in, creating a bright, inviting environment.</i></p> </div> </section>
